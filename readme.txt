CSCI 3080 ola2, ternary tree
The first number is the number of nodes in the graph. For the rest of the rows, the first number in a list is the node in question, 
the rest of the numbers in a list are nodes that are children of the first node. So there will be 4 numbers on each line. 
A "-1" means there is no child for that location. The root of the tree will always be node 1
